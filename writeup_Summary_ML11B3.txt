The following tasks were done :

1.Importing Libraries and Data:
Pandas,numpy,matplotlib


2.Preprocessing Data:
Dropping unnecessary features, null values dropped,converting to lowe case strings,

3.We have answered 2 questions on the dataset-
  1.  To get placed with highest salary which degree should be Opted?
  2. Which specialisation has the highest "mba_p" ?

4.Classificiation Algorithms
 -Algorithm 1: SVM
 -Algorithm 2: Logistic Regression
 -Algorithm 3: KNN
 
5. Result
    Accuracy 
   - SVM                 :68.51%
   -Logistic Regression  :77.77%
   -KNN                  :75.92%

6.Conclusion      

It can be concluded that for the models developed, The logistic regression gave the best performance with 0.77777 score.
We see the best model is Logistic Regression with 77.77% accuracy, followed by KNN Classification with 75.92% accuracy and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with 68.51% accuracy.
